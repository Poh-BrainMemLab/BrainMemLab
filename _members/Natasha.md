Natasha is a postdoctoral research fellow at Centre for Sleep & Cognition, National University of Singapore. She graduated with a PhD in computational neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. Mac Shine at the University of Sydney. Her research focuses on the role of the ascending arousal system in facilitating dynamic brain state transitions in both healthy and diseased brains, and how these brain state transitions are critical for normal brain function and cognition. She utilizes methods from network neuroscience, multi-modal imaging, and dynamical systems to explore how fluctuations in the underlying ascending arousal systems contribute to changes in brain states and cognition. In her current role, she will leverage large-scale neuroimaging datasets to examine neuromodulatory influences in brain dynamics, with a focus on their role in memory function.
