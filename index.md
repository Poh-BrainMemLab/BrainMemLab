# Our Research

The memories we hold are fundamental to our identity and sense of self. Yet, memories are often transient; and much of what we experience is inevitably forgotten. 

What determines if certain experiences are transformed into lasting memories? How do fluctuations in brain activity influence what we perceive and remember? Can we learn to regulate our brain activity to enhance our learning?

At the Dynamic Brain and Memory Lab, our goal is to uncover the processes and neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Our lab combines brain imaging, behavioural experiments, and computational modeling to study how fluctuations in brain activity relate to changes in behaviour and cognition. Our investigations aim to guide the development of clinical interventionsand tools to enhance cognitive function in the wider population.
