# Our Research

The memories we hold are fundamental to our identity and our sense of self. Yet, our memories are often transient and much of what we experienced are inevitably forgotten. What determines if certain experiences are transformed into long lasting memories? How do fluctuations in brain activity influence what we perceive and remember? And can we then  learn to regulate our brain activity to enhance our capacity for learning?

At the Dynamic Brain and Memory Lab, our goal is to uncover the processes and neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Using brain imaging in conjunction with behavioral experiments and computational modeling, our lab studies how changes in brain activity can translate to changes in behavior and cognition. This would ultimately inform the developments of tools and approaches for clinical interventions and also for the enhancement of cognitive functions in healthy populations.
