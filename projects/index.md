<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#328f7b; font-weight:bold">Motivation, curiosity, and learning</h3>

{% capture text %}

* Our learning is often influenced by our motivational states. For example, we might be motivated to read a Neuroscience textbook because we are curious about the topic or we may be trying to memorise all the information for an upcoming exam. Such distinct motivational states that are overlaid on our learning experiences, can determine how we learn and what we remember.
* Our work has shown that intrinsic motivation associated with curiosity can enhance memory formation and also increase the willingness to engage with the learning process. In ongoing work, we will examine how curiosity can be developed and fostered to support self-directed learning. We will also examine how different ‘forms’ of curiosity can drive information seeking to direct learning and memory formation.

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#328f7b; font-weight:bold">Brain states and information processing</h3>

{% capture text %}

* Spontaneous fluctuations in brain states, associated with changes in the patterns of local and network activity, can determine how information is processed and propagated across different brain areas. These fluctuations in brain states may reflect intrinsic variation in internal states (e.g. vigilance, arousal, emotional state, motivational states), or could also reflect changes associated with alterations in brain anatomy (e.g. across development, aging, or neurodegeneration).
* Our work has shown that memory formation can be influenced by the stability of brain activity, and by neuromodulatory influence of memory systems. Currently, we are examining how different motivations (e.g reward approach and punishment avoidance) can elicit distinct brain states to bias the modes of information-seeking and memory formation.

<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#328f7b; font-weight:bold">Enhancing human cognition with neurofeedback</h3>

{% capture text %}

* We regularly attempt to control over our cognitive states in our daily lives - think about how you might try to hype yourself up to go for a run after a long day, or how you might try to calm yourself down before a major presentation. Individuals often employ a diverse range of strategies to regulate their cognitive states, but this can often come with varying degrees of success. Neurofeedback provides individuals a tool whereby they can learn to control their brain states by using a readout of their own brain activity.
* Prior work have shown that humans can develop a remarkable ability to self-regulate brain activity across multiple regions, including in deep brain structures that are centrally implicated in motivation and learning. In ongoing work, we will examine if real-time fMRI neurofeedback can be used to regulate brain activity for the modulation of learning and memory formation.
